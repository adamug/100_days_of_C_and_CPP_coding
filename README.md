## C++

I'd start learning C++ from scratch, hopefully after 25 days in which I plan to complete C, following the book "Object Oriented Programming with C++" by E. Balagurusamy </br>
You can purchase the book from: https://www.amazon.in/Object-Oriented-Programming-C-Balagurusamy/dp/9352607996 </br>
