# 100 days of code challenge
## C

I'd start by revising my knowledge of C programming, following the book "Programming in C" by Reema Thareja </br> 
Purchase from: https://www.amazon.in/Programming-C-Reema-Thareja/dp/0199456143 </br>

Day 1: Area of triangle; Euclidean distance between two points; </br>
Day 2: ASCII value of character; Ternary operator; Upper to lower; </br>

## C++

I'd start learning C++ from scratch, hopefully after 25 days in which I plan to complete C, following the book "Object Oriented Programming with C++" by E. Balagurusamy </br>
You can purchase the book from: https://www.amazon.in/Object-Oriented-Programming-C-Balagurusamy/dp/9352607996 </br>
